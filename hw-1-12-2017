Absolute vs Relative Paths - use "~" to navigate to her home directory 

Relative Path Resolution - ../backup display refers to the /Users/backup

ls Reading Comprehension - the "ls" without a directory argument lists the files and directories in the current directory and also it uses the absolute path explictly (correct answer is #4, which is both #1 & #2)

Exploring more ls Arguments - the -l makes ls use a long listing format such as file size and last modification. the -h makes the file size "human readable" (showing 5.3k instead of 5369)

Listing Recursively and By Time - the directories are displayed in alphabetical order on each level, the files/directories in each directory are classified by time of last change
